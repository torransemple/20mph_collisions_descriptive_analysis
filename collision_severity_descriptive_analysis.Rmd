#### Notebook description:
This notebook contains a descriptive analysis of road traffic collisions in Edinburgh and Glasgow from 2010-2022. Traffic trends are also explored to account for exposure (i.e., collisions corrected for traffic flow)

<br>

#### Data sources:
The road traffic collisions (RTC) data used in this notebook were derived from the UK Gov.'s STATS19 database (see: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data); traffic data were downloaded from the UK Gov.'s traffic statistics (see: https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads)

## 1. Load required packages
```{r setup}

# Install required packages if necessary
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
if(!require(cowplot)) install.packages("cowplot")

# Load required packages

# For visualisations
library(ggplot2) 

# For arranging visualisations
library(cowplot) 

```


## 2. Load and view Edinburgh and Glasgow summary stats (ED_GLA) and the equivalent summary data for single-vehicle, low-speed (20/30mph) collisions (ED_GLA_SV_LS)
```{r}

# Load combined Edinburgh & Glasgow summary stats for collisions and traffic
ED_GLA <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torransemple/20mph_collisions_descriptive_analysis/refs/heads/main/data/ED_GLA_collisions_traffic_summary.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Load combined single-vehicle, low-speed summary stats in Edinburgh & Glasgow (note: traffic statistics are not directly comparable with this subset)
ED_GLA_SV_LS <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torransemple/20mph_collisions_descriptive_analysis/refs/heads/main/data/ED_GLA_SV_LS_collisions_traffic_summary.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# View/check structure of ED_GLA
str(ED_GLA)

# Notes on ED_GLA variables
# 'year' = year between 2010 and 2022 (i.e., the study period)
# 'number_collisions' = absolute number of collisions per year
# 'ksi_prop' = % of collisions resulting in killed or seriously injured (KSI) outcomes per year
# 'ksi_count' = number of KSIs per year
# 'fatal_prop' = % of collisions resulting in fatal outcomes per year
# 'fatal_count' = number of fatalities per year
# 'annual_avg' = average AADF (traffic) per year
# 'cycle_avg_year' = cycles AADF
# 'bus_avg_year' = buses AADF
# 'car_avg_year' = cars AADF
# 'city' = Edinburgh or Glasgow
# 'annual_aadf' = annual AADF (i.e., 'annual_avg' * 365) 
# 'ksi_annual_rate' = KSI rate/exposure, i.e., number of KSIs divided by annual AADF per 100,000 vehicles
# 'collision_annual_rate' = collision rate/exposure, i.e., number of collisions divided by annual AADF per 100,000 vehicles

# Note: ED_GLA_SV_LS has less variables given that the subset is not compatible with the traffic data, which refer to the entire transport network per city

```
